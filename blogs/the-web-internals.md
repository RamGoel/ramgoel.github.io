For the longest time, I've been working on webdev but interestingly I never understood how everything worked under the hood, till the interview I recently faced which literally forced me to rethink if I am a good dev or not.

It was time to brush up on the fundamentals of web, and especially going deep with the fundamentals of JavaScript. So I got back to the chat with one senior I had a year ago, found that one OG resource for the OG javascript.

-   [javascript.info](https://javascript.info)

I would say that if you think you know javascript, maybe you need to look at the comments on this website. They're the real OG.

like the every caveat of javascript, how `NaN` is shit. What are these `null` and `undefined`. This website got you.

# The React Internals

Today is the day I thought of jumping into the internals of React and how this fuckin awesome library works under the hood, and found some cool tech talks which could help you out.

-   Why the hell we needed React. [The React Intro](https://youtu.be/SAIdyBFHfVU?si=WBpqmNwlFMRSFTQK)
-   Understand how reconcilation, diffing, virtual DOM works in React. [How React Renders](https://youtu.be/i793Qm6kv3U?si=kEAu134OWrjiAe6H)

Hope they helps, see you on the other side :)
